# President
New Perspectives on JavaScript and AJAX 
Complete the following: 
1. Using the material found in the tutorial.06\case4 folder, create a Web page named president.htm. 
Include a comment section that describes the contents of your file and includes your name and the date.
You may supplement the content provided for your Web page with any other content you think is appropriate for the task.
2. The design and layout of the page are up to you. Place the style definitions for your Web page in an external file named pm.css. 
Include a comment section in the file that documents its use and includes your name and the date. 
Link your Web page to this style sheet. 3. Create an external JavaScript file named survey.js 
that contains the code to enable users to drag and drop elements on the president.htm Web page. 
A few functions have been stored in the library.js file to help you with your program.
The code should contain examples of the following features: 
a. Event handlers that involve event capturing supported under 
both event models
b. Removing event handlers using a function that supports both event models 
c. Working with the properties of the event object under both event models 
d. Event handlers that respond to actions of the mouse 
e. Commands that modify the cursor style of an object 
4. Link the Web page to the external JavaScript file and test the functionality of the page.
Verify that you can drag and drop individual presidential portraits from their default location to their ranking on the list. 
5. Submit the completed project to your instructor.
